# My Front End Journey: CSS Basic

Welcome to the next stage of my <a href="https://github.com/dedekharisma/my-frontend-journey">front-end development journey</a>! This repository is all about learning the basics of **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**, the language that gives life to web pages by making them visually appealing.

## What You'll Learn in This Series

In this part of "My Front End Journey", Iâ€™ll be exploring the foundational concepts of CSS. Here's what I aim to cover:

- **CSS Syntax and Selectors**: Understanding how CSS works and how to target HTML elements using selectors like classes (`.class`), IDs (`#id`), and element selectors (`element`).
- **Colors and Typography**: Applying color, fonts, and text properties to style the content and make it visually appealing.
- **Box Model**: Learning how to control layout and spacing through properties like `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `width`/`height`.
- **Display and Positioning**: Exploring different display values (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`) and positioning techniques (static, relative, absolute, fixed).
- **Flexbox**: A beginner's introduction to creating flexible layouts using the CSS Flexbox model.
- **Responsive Design**: Understanding media queries and how to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

## Repository Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML page that contains the structure of the content.
- `style.css`: The CSS file where all styling is applied to the HTML elements.
- `README.md`: This file explaining the purpose of the repository and how it fits into my learning series.

## Why CSS Matters

While HTML provides the structure, **CSS is what makes a website look good**. From colors to fonts, layout to spacing, CSS gives you full control over the visual appearance of your web pages. Learning the basics of CSS is a crucial step in becoming a front-end developer who can not only build functional sites but also create visually attractive and user-friendly experiences.

## What's Next?

After learning the basics of CSS, the next step in my journey will be to explore **JavaScript**, which will help me add interactivity to web pages. Stay tuned for the upcoming repository that dives into the world of dynamic web development!

Thanks for joining me on this journey, and as always, happy coding!
